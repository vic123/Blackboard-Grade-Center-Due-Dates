a. Initial import/check-in - see dates of files. 
b. Creation (or not) of checked-in folder name in repository.
c. Creation of empty folder and recursion
TortoiseSVN:
Import folder testSVN (rclick on folder)
to http://projects.oscelot.org/svn/gc_duedates/trunk/testSVN
(/trunk/testSVN added manually to URL)
